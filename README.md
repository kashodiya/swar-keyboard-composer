## What is [Swar Keyboard Composer](https://kashodiya.github.io/swar-keyboard-composer/#/)?
This is web based tool for anyone who is practicing Indian Classical Music. This tool can record audio as well as the keystrokes. You can download that recording (audio + keys info). This recording can later be played. You can send it to someone. When you play it, you not only hear the audio but also will be able to see the swars used.  
Best thing about this tool is that it is a online web based tool, you do not need to install anything on your computer.
